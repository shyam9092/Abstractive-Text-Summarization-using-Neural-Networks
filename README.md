# EEE-511-Final-Team-Project

## Guidelines 

>Study a significant machine learning problem/tool/application/theory\ 
>Explain how it work, best to demonstrate the basic working principle by an example\
>Explain the structure of the problem solution approach and algorithm(s) employed\
>Describe how to access the dataset, clearly specify the training and testing datasets (strongly encourage self-collected test datasets). Include results of both training and testing\ 
>Describe step by step how to implement the solution (include all technical details, such as system requirements, software packages, setup procedure, data source, papers used for modeling after, and more) In a nutshell, prepare your work to answer what, why and how questions on the subject you choose to study.\

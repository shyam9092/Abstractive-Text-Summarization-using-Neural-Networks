# EEE-511-Final-Team-Project

## Guidelines 

• Study a significant machine learning problem/tool/application/theory \
• Explain how it work, best to demonstrate the basic working principle by an example\
• Explain the structure of the problem solution approach and algorithm(s) employed\
• Describe how to access the dataset, clearly specify the training and testing datasets (strongly encourage self-collected test datasets). Include results of both   training and testing<br/>
• Describe step by step how to implement the solution (include all technical details, such as system requirements, software packages, setup procedure, data source, papers used for modeling after, and more) In a nutshell, prepare your work to answer what, why and how questions on the subject you choose to study

## Problem Statement (2 Points) (02/05)

Format: 1-page ppt to include\
• Concise description of the problem/application – be specific.\
• Specific references (1. Papers and/or book chapters, 2. online open-source datasets, 3. System requirement to simulate, 4. code...) \
• Expected outcomes (towards explaining how you are going to demonstrate your results in the end?) \
• Specify who is going to do what for the upcoming PC#1, what measures to use in case a member is not responsive

## Progress Check 1 (5 points) (02/26)

1.Provide a concise, concrete and clear problem formulation (can be updated from the previous 1-pager to be more accurate). Aim at clearly explaining a theory/application/tool to the audience, demonstrating how it works, and describing your expected results ( show-and-tell, use images and videos and other creative means). Avoid being too general or too narrow\
2.Identify key literature, datasets (training and testing), implementation code (can be updated from previous version if necessary)\
3.Describe procedures you take to set up simulations in your chosen system to establish the computation platform in order to demonstrate your project by answering the following questions<br/>
• What is the computing platform to perform the computation<br/> 
• How to install needed software environment<br/>
• Have you test run the code successfully (if the answer is no, there will be point deductions)<br/> 
• Provide clear evidence when answering the above questions in the report<br/> 
• Describe what examples you’re going to use for demonstration<br/>
• Describe how you will be collecting your own data and demonstrate the results<br/>
• Summarize your progress to date in a report of no more than 3 pages (it is fine if you have 2 pages) in IEEE article [template](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-journal-article/authoring-tools-and-templates/tools-for-ieee-authors/ieee-article-templates/)<br/>   
• In your report, clearly indicate what is under development and identify who is going to do what.

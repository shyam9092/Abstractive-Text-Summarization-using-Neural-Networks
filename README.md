# EEE-511-Final-Team-Project

## Guidelines 

• Study a significant machine learning problem/tool/application/theory \
• Explain how it work, best to demonstrate the basic working principle by an example\
• Explain the structure of the problem solution approach and algorithm(s) employed\
• Describe how to access the dataset, clearly specify the training and testing datasets (strongly encourage self-collected test datasets). Include results of both   training and testing \ 
• Describe step by step how to implement the solution (include all technical details, such as system requirements, software packages, setup procedure, data source, papers used for modeling after, and more) In a nutshell, prepare your work to answer what, why and how questions on the subject you choose to study.

## Problem Statement (02/05)

Format: 1-page ppt to include\
• Concise description of the problem/application – be specific.\
• Specific references (1. Papers and/or book chapters, 2. online open-source datasets, 3. System requirement to simulate, 4. code...) \
• Expected outcomes (towards explaining how you are going to demonstrate your results in the end?) \
• Specify who is going to do what for the upcoming PC#1, what measures to use in case a member is not responsive
